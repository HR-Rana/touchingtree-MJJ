								<p>I’ve been drawn to helping others for a very long time. One of my clearest memories of kindergarten was being asked to help another little girl learn to read and feeling so good about that. Then, I volunteered in middle and high school as a peer mentor and ended up being a learning mentor in college as well (you might be sensing a theme here). When I went to graduate school the first time, I became an English teacher for middle and high schoolers. Since that time, I’ve taught middle school English in two different states, stayed home with my own children when they were young, written several books, and gone to graduate school AGAIN to become a therapist. So. Much. Helping. But, that’s what calls me.</p>

								It was crazy and a little exciting to me when I realized that all of my past life experiences: helping, teaching, marrying, parenting, divorcing, and writing were joining together to support my role as a therapist and, even more than that, as a therapist that specializes in high conflict relationships. This is not what my little kindergarten self imagined when she felt that first joy of being a helper! And yet, I’m so grateful to be here.

								My work, for the last many years, has been to notice and interpret patterns and cycles in high conflict relationships. Even more than that, though, my work has been to develop and test out strategies that change those patterns and cycles and to help my clients feel like they’ve gotten their lives back. It turns out that knowing how, when, and why we should change our reactions to high conflict people can actually free us and allow us to manifest who we really want to be!

When I’m not doing what I do for others, I’m out back vegetable gardening or up near Lake Superior, hiking whenever I can.</p>

							<p>I’ve designed this course to be as practical and effective as possible. That said, every relationship is different so I can’t 100% guarantee results in a certain timeframe. Most of my private practice clients start to see very clear changes in themselves or their relationships after 6-8 weeks, so if you dedicate at least 1-2 hours per week to watching videos, completing workbooks sections, and putting the strategies into use, you will see positive changes in that timeframe!</p>
